### To do

- [ ] The average/best score labels should be one increment larger, and the numbers on the axis should be smaller
- [ ] The move score chart should go back to being a histogram - there are just too many moves
- [ ] Enable scrolling on the list of past games

### Done

- [x] The drop shadows on the player panels on the statistics page should be solid and horizontally centered, like they are on other elements
- [x] Make the vertical line for average scores more prominent. For the best scores, we don't need a line - just the label
- [x] Add more space between the move score and game score sections, and make the headings bold
- [x] On the statistics page, move & game info should appear on tap or click rather than hover (since this is primarily used on mobile)
