### To do

- [ ] Describe this application in the README.

### Done

- [x] the header doesn't need that much vertical padding
- [x] link game score tooltips to the game
- [x] draw a line from best game score label to that game's dot
- [x] on the chart, center the `avg: X` label on the line. And allow enough space at the top of the chart so the label doesn't overlap with any of the chart elements
- [x] Show more ticks on axes
- [x] Don't show tooltips on word score histograms
- [x] For best moves score, include words
- [x] New game: focus next player automatically until there are two players
- [x] On histogram, bars should abut x-axis. On game score chart, spacing between dots and axis should match spacing between dots
- [x] Test games button is too low on the screen on iPhone
- [x] make the ring around the active player panel just 1 px
- [x] show the test games button if there are no games (not only on first run)
- [x] the "create test games" button should only appear on first use
- [x] make padding around the app consistent - on the game screen, the arrow and the board and the first panel and the first button should all be left-aligned
- [x] when correcting, the "Editing move" heading as well as the cancel/save buttons should use the standard header component
- [x] Find some games that include both failed and successful challenges
- [x] Change the name of the app to Scorable throughout the repo
- [x] Fix scrolling on past games list and statistics page
- [x] add more vertical padding around each player's statistics
- [x] Add a little padding inside the average and best labels, as well as margin around them
- [x] Make average and best scores bold (just the number, not the text part of the label)
- [x] Make the move scores chart a bit taller, and add some padding at top so that the average label isn't touching any of the elements of the chart itself
- [x] Make the vertical lines showing the average 1px thick and a darker version of the graph color. Give the average and best labels a solid color background of that same color.
- [x] The move score chart should go back to being a histogram - there are just too many moves
- [x] On the statistics page add colons after `avg` and `best`
- [x] On the statistics page sometimes the avg and best labels overlap each other. let's put the avg label on the top of the chart, flush left against the line
- [x] Position tooltips next to the selected dot instead of fixed position above chart
- [x] Enable scrolling on the list of past games
- [x] The average/best score labels should be one increment larger, and the numbers on the axis should be smaller
- [x] The drop shadows on the player panels on the statistics page should be solid and horizontally centered, like they are on other elements
- [x] Make the vertical line for average scores more prominent. For the best scores, we don't need a line - just the label
- [x] Add more space between the move score and game score sections, and make the headings bold
- [x] On the statistics page, move & game info should appear on tap or click rather than hover (since this is primarily used on mobile)
