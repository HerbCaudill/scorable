### To do

- [ ] add more vertical padding around each player's statistics
- [ ] The move score chart should go back to being a histogram - there are just too many moves

### Done

- [x] On the statistics page add colons after `avg` and `best`
- [x] On the statistics page sometimes the avg and best labels overlap each other. let's put the avg label on the top of the chart, flush left against the line
- [x] Position tooltips next to the selected dot instead of fixed position above chart
- [x] Enable scrolling on the list of past games
- [x] The average/best score labels should be one increment larger, and the numbers on the axis should be smaller
- [x] The drop shadows on the player panels on the statistics page should be solid and horizontally centered, like they are on other elements
- [x] Make the vertical line for average scores more prominent. For the best scores, we don't need a line - just the label
- [x] Add more space between the move score and game score sections, and make the headings bold
- [x] On the statistics page, move & game info should appear on tap or click rather than hover (since this is primarily used on mobile)
