### 2026-01-11: Fixed backspace to skip over existing tiles

**Problem:** When entering tiles that span existing tiles on the board (e.g., placing letters before and after an existing word), backspace only worked up until the first existing tile was encountered. Users had to manually click on remaining new tiles to continue deleting.

**Solution:** Added a `findPreviousPosition` function in `ScrabbleBoard.tsx` that mirrors `findNextPosition` but moves backward. Updated the backspace handler to use this function with `skipExisting: true`, allowing the cursor to skip over existing tiles when finding the previous new tile to delete.

**Files changed:**

- `src/components/ScrabbleBoard.tsx` - Added `findPreviousPosition` and updated backspace logic
- `e2e/tests/board-interaction.test.ts` - Added new test "backspace skips over existing tiles"

**Tests:** All backspace-related tests pass. Note: The "space places blank tile" tests were already failing (pre-existing issue related to blank tile dialog).
