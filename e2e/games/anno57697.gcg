#note Missed ADZ here. BBK? looks odd, but I very often draw into KIBB? 3I at least. Sim likes ADZ by a bit here.

#note SPOUTINgS (which I didn't know) sims a little better win%-wise, the idea is probably that column M bingos set up another bingo line, while column C bingos don't.

#note CPS looked like it had decent bingo potential with this pool, also considered SCOPE. Sim has SCOPE at better win% and equity, so it might be a little better, this is fine.
