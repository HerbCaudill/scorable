>Alice: EELLMUY H8 MULEY +28 28
#note 2.5 better to add the other L (MULLEY).  If I end up holding SCULDER* some time later I'd be giggling...
>Bob: EJNN 12D JENN. +30 30
>Alice: AEIILOU 10E AIO.I +7 35
#note MIAOU 8H is technically better (by 5)...
>Bob: EFOR 13C FORE +27 57
>Alice: AAELOQU B10 AQUAE +40 75
#note ... but the draw makes me look psychic, as I would have been in a pickle had I made the "right" play.
>Bob: ?EEELPR J4 PEELERs +65 122
#note Missing the lovely REExPEL A4 79
>Alice: ALNOORT A4 ORTOLAN +76 151
#note REExPEL would have left me totally in the lurch with this one.
>Bob: GOUV 6F VOGU. +17 139
>Alice: ?ADHITT K3 HID +24 175
#note DAH scores extra but there's more I's left than A's.  Shouldn't that make this play closer than -4?

#note I need defense here, so I dispute that A14 MY 25 is +13 to this play.  +5 maybe.
>Bob: AADDHRZ N13 HA. +27 290
>Alice: DGMNRUZ M10 GRUM +30 395
#note Why is DRUM better here? Even by .5?
>Bob: AADEIRS F5 A.A +16 306
