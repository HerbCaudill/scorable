#note Tricky turn with nothing that stood out. The main option I missed here was ASLEEP 14A (I just saw ASLOPE in that spot). Also wonderd about YOMPS/YOMP. Was trying to balance leave with what I gave back with this play. Sim likes ASLEEP here, I agree.

#note It appeared he missed QAT. I think I spent most of my time on this turn retracking?

#note I was totally blindsided by this!! Oof, still hurts, though I was also impressed. Interesting how the process of him putting this down is still somewhat vivid in my memory, compared to many other events. He did miss QAT though. According to macondo, I do not have an honest win here, with the best sequence being WIST-RUG-WE-IZARD for a 3 point loss. However, I should clearly try, and I think my best option if I see SPELTZ is to block it, rather than hope he doesn't see it, as I think he has a tough position in front of him if I play WIST or EW. My position on IINQSTW is tougher than I thought in some ways because of SPELTZ, but maybe also better in some ways in case I draw it? I suspect I should either block with WIST or play QI and hope to draw it myself, WIST appears better as I will often draw a U and even if I don't draw a U the endgame might be tough for him (I was looking at what would've happened with what was actually in the bag with Quackle a bit and it didn't look clear whether he would beat me; macondo endgame confirms that he can win in that case, but it could be tricky). Peg thinks WIST is the prohibitive favorite on the IINQSTW turn, which does seem plausible, though some of its analysis might be wrong because I didn't run it at a high depth. Too bad I didn't play it, especially since I was strongly considering it even without seeing SPELTZ.

#note Maybe my worst-played game of the tournament: SPELT, WIS, and QAT all look quite bad, with HYOID as a small mistake.
