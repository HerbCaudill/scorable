#note Sim likes DODGY, which I considered, but maybe I didn't notice some of its merits enough: blocks both Rs some, blocks the E and O, and blocks the 4K line for scoring and opening. That's a good defensive play.

#note Didn't consider much else here, but DEMO and DEMOING are available. Maybe this is just too bad with row 3 available and the Q and X spot it opens up. It's possibly not a bad response to fishing.

#note This might be too nuts, I also considered K9 plays (though didn't see MOANED). But I'm suspecting this is too short-sighted ... there are a lot of ways to open this board even if this closes the best lines immediately. And it still leaves some lines anyway. Should probably just play CANED or maybe MOANED. I saw ANADEM as well but didn't like open up the 3x3.

#note I think the idea here was to block the top and keep a decent looking leave ... maybe liked the A too much here? The sim doesn't like this very much, not sure if it is wrong? Sim likes PERV which might be OK because row 1 looks pretty weak with this pool. Jason can still open on the bottom, hm. PLATER is decent, PERVO is also.

#note Saw NEUTRINO (the only bingo after this) and felt that I might lose if he drew the M afterward, but it turns out AGIN, which I think I'd have found with my bit of time left, wins in that case. Also considered NONE, which leaves bingos on the left, including some I missed, and seemed more questionable, but from looking at endgames that also seems to be a 100% win.

#note Did a somewhat poor  job thinking about the board and finding plays here in the midgame with DASHY, CODEIA, SPRAIN. SLING and VET possibly also  mistakes.
